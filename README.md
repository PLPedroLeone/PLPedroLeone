## 🚀 About Me
Hi! 👋🏼 I'm Pedro, I initially studied Biological Sciences, obtaining a Masters degree in that field.

I'm a person who is always craving for new knowledge, professional and personal growth, so in 2024 I decided to reinvent myself. I started a new journey in an area I was always passionate about: programming.

As part of my training in this new web development career, I developed competencies in many technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Git, NodeJS, Express, NestJS, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and working frameworks like Agile working and Scrum.

Being a person attracted to science I specialized in BackEnd development. I reached the conclusion that every solution to most problems can be found in an organized data base architecture and a clean business logic. I firmly believe that these two aspects of programming are the core of every solution, and my plan is to master them.

I consider that my background in a science career brought me a critical way of thinking, serious analitic capabilities, quick learning skills and massive communication skills.

These skills, coupled with my experience in customer service and sales, allow me to bring organizations a comprehensive understanding of user experience, business needs, and production processes.

I bring to the table not only the ability to write clean and efficient code, but also the mindset to solve real-world problems, communicate effectively across teams, adapt quickly to change, and stay focused on delivering value. My goal is to contribute to projects where technology, creativity, and human understanding come together to create impactful solutions.
